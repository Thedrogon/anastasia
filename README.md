## 🎨 The Philosophy

**Anastasia** was engineered to solve the "OLED Black" problem. Pure black backgrounds often cause harsh eye strain and "text ghosting" during long coding sessions.

This theme utilizes a **Deep Matte Green (`#041F1A`)** foundation—a chalkboard-like surface that absorbs light rather than reflecting it. This is paired with high-energy **Neon Spring (`#00FF9D`)** indicators and **Pale Mint** text to create a high-contrast environment that remains soft on the eyes.

It is not just a theme; it is a specialized environment for focused development.

## ✨ Features

* **Matte Surface Technology:** The background is a specific deep pine shade designed to reduce halation and eye fatigue.
* **Semantic Neon:** High-priority indicators (cursors, errors, active tabs) glow with a neon spring green (`#00FF9D`).
* **Logic Separation:**
    * **Data** (Strings/Numbers) is colored in warm Emeralds and Ambers.
    * **Logic** (Keywords/Control Flow) is colored in cool Purples and Cyans.
* **"Waterfall" UI:** The sidebar and file explorer use a seamless gradient of greens, removing harsh gray borders found in default themes.
* **Readability First:** Comments use a specialized **Sage Green** contrast ratio (3:1) to ensure they are visible but unobtrusive.

## 👋 About the Author

Hi, I’m **Sayanjit Mukherjee** — a software engineering student on the path to becoming a full-time software engineer.

I enjoy working with **JavaScript and TypeScript**, especially on thoughtfully designed codebases where clarity, performance, and developer experience matter. Most of my personal projects are built in **TypeScript**, and I’m particularly interested in crafting clean, focused tools that developers can live in for hours.

When I’m not writing code, I’m usually refining small details that most people don’t notice — until they do.
